Quick, ad-hoc interaction with REDCap's web API for easier development and
exploration.

If stdout is to a terminal and the `vd` (https://visidata.org) command is
available, output will automatically be displayed in it.

The API endpoint and authentication token must be provided via the
environment variables REDCAP_API_URL and REDCAP_API_TOKEN.

Besides any normal arguments they take, all commands also accept raw REDCap
API parameters as "key=value" arguments.  For example, normally running:

    redcap record 42

would return data from all instruments/forms for record #42.  You can limit
to specific instruments of interest using:

    redcap record 42 forms=some_instrument_name
